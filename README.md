Philia Contacts
===============

UWP application meant to serve as a central contact organizer. Imports and exports vCard file format.

Manage all your contacts centrally and cleanly. Import from, or export to, your Android or Apple contacts using the universal vCard (Virtual Contact File) format.

Background
----------
When I got home, after switching from iPhone to Android, I noticed many of the contacts in my phone doubled. Looking closer I realized they did not necessarily clone exactly. I had many repeats of people, but some pieces of data were different. After looking into the problem, I learned that my Apple contacts were copied over in the store while Android automatically pulled my google contacts from online. Creating one big mess. 

After finding out that both Apple and google (among others) can import and export lists of contacts using the same format, .vcf, I decided to build this application and manage my own contacts from now on.
